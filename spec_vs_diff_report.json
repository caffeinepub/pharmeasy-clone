  "summary": "The diff implements a substantial portion of all four requirements. REQ-21 (Admin Panel) is largely complete with all five management sections, sidebar navigation, and proper access control. REQ-22 (backend admin functions) shows Motoko backend modifications with admin-guarded functions. REQ-23 (aarthiscan.com-inspired UI redesign) shows only a modified App.tsx routing — no evidence of a redesigned Home page, hero banner, Why Choose Us strip, How It Works section, testimonials, or updated footer. REQ-24 (image upload in admin) is implemented via ImageUploadField component. Several REQ-23 acceptance criteria are not evidenced in the diff.",
